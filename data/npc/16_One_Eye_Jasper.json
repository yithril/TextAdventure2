  "description": "Jasper's muscled body is riddled with scars and scabs from recent wounds.  His head is shaved spotless and his bushy, fire red eyebrows bob up and down as he lets out a guffaw.  He dons an eye patch over his left eye, no doubt a trophy from his much talked about days in the arena.  His grin is dotted with holes.",
