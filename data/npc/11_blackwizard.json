  "description": "Josephus is a rather handsome, rugged wizard, far from the usual perception of a pale bookworm.  His cleft jaw and stark features are striking.  His hair is jet black, slick, and cropped back.  His robes are as dark as night, and occasionally, you see a twinkle of what could be starlight.",
