  "description": "Gillard is a rather homely looking halfling.  He has a nervous air about him, constantly fiddling through file papers or rushing to and fro.  His hair is wild and unkempt, spiking out in odd directions.  He dons a ragged suit coat, a pair of shorts, and a tie that is too short to reach his waist.",
